Rodrigo commanded and fought with the grace of nobility and fury of an estranged mercenary, having been exiled after being unjustly judged guilty for the murder of his liege. His sense of justice and devotion against all odds earned him a spot in the annals of Estalian history, but not just due to his namesake and achievements. For his \"Conqueror\" status didn't come from his personal heroics alone.</p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to most of the Estalian common folk, the nobility became more infatuated with Rodrigo's organizational skills than his many other achievements. The man was mainly responsible for the creation of the \"Tercio\", a professional mercenary unit made up of combining the long reach and stalwart formation of spearmen, the stopping power and damage of arbalests (later handguns to greater effect) and the flexibility and combat prowess of heavy swordsmen. This type of unit, often fighting in combination with more mobile units of Almogavars, was attributed with the most significant victories during the Reconquista of Estalia from Araby after Sultan Jaffar&rsquo;s invasion in the 15th Century IC. And the nobles were quick to emulate this success, creating their own units of professional mercenaries in the same spirit.</p>\n<p>While not as renowned as most Tilean Dogs of War (Estalians will often cite mischievous self-aggrandizing on the Tileans part), these \"Compa&ntilde;ias de Tercio\", made of up hardened \"Conquistadores\" carrying the legacy of the legend that made them, present the cleaner, nobler version of Estalian military might, in contrast to their rugged Almogavar companions. Their experience battling in Araby and the New World make them a force to be reckoned with, one sure to pin down any army foolish enough to seek open battle... for the right price, of course.</p>\n<p>From the New World, Conquistadors returning home tell tales of ancient floating cities of gold and roaring monsters that snap armored knights in two with a single snap of their jaws. Of the few whom return alive, they are wealthy beyond their wildest dreams, bringing with them exotic armors, weapons, trinkets and ships full of gold enough to bring a popper to a king overnight. These tails inspire new conquistadors to enlist and seek new fortune in the colonies of Lustria&hellip; but even fewer return, and the cycle repeats. Most Conquistadors are content taking jobs in the Southern Realms and the Old World, with the Border Princes, Empire and Marienburg being their predominant employers; however in recent years under Tzar Boris the Red, a few lucky Estalians have even found high paying work in the courts of Kislev to the far east.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Estalian)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Conquistador Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

It is their duty to always be prepared for war, as invasions of Mother Kislev are an all too common occurrence to simply ignore. Even though they are themselves of only modest rank, the Lancers enjoy a great deal of respect from the people of Kislev for their role in protecting the nation. Each stanitsa or settlement is expected to provide a force of Winged Lancers for the mutual defense of the nation, which are often the focus of great civic pride.</p>\n<p>Their standards have usually seen many battles and their loyalty is fanatical. The famed feathered wings are the invention of the great historical warrior, Tzar Alexandr Njevski, whose winged back banner emanated an eerie howl that no Chaos worshipper could endure. The winged lancers are a Gospodar tradition, and most Gospodar stanitsas support a rota, or squadron of them, often consisting of nearly all the men of the settlement.</p>\n<p>These mounted warriors are famed for their elaborately decorated armor, most especially the large, feathered &lsquo;wings&rsquo; mounted on their back that make an eerie sound when they charge. The rest of the armor is decorated as richly as the stanitsa can manage, as a matter of pride and the warriors only don their impressive armor immediately before battle to avoid damaging it in everyday use. Unsurprisingly, their primary weapon is the lance, but they also use swords for closer fighting, often discarding their lances after an initial charge. While not as manoeuvrable as the Ungol horse archers, they are still a highly mobile force and the mainstay of Kislevite armies. They are, however, not full-time soldiers and often seem more loyal to their home than to Tzarina Katarin. Nevertheless, they fight bravely against Chaos, and so the Ice Queen is more concerned with other political problems.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Gospodar or Ungol)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Winged Lancer Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

To the far east, beyond the Mountains of Mourn stands the Land of a Thousand Gods. Many kingdoms pepper this sacred land as the people of Ind, much like their western counterparts, are prone to war on all sides--from Greenskins and Chaos to between bickering kingdoms seeking conquest and glory.</p>\n<p>At the heart of Ind lies its caste system, with merchants, artists, the peasantry and the like at the lower. The warrior and noble caste reigns supreme with the elite warriors of Ind being the very bridge that links the two together, the Rajput. These legendary warriors hold great status over the people as valiant warriors, duelists, mercenaries and are seen as arbiters of the gods&rsquo; wills. Their tremendous sense of duty combined with years of education and training gives them a much greater edge over the traditional militia forces and mercenaries often seen around Ind.</p>\n<p>They can often be found traveling the Spice Road, defending caravans from Dark Elf raiders, hobgoblins and hostile ogre tribes littering the trail. This has granted them a huge amount of renown among the merchant class in Ind and even Cathay, carving through the worst many travelers have to contend with on their dangerous travels to the Empire and beyond. Their combat style imitates like a dance of death, mimicking the elegance and combat prowess of their god Shaivi.</p>\n<p>To this day the Rajput remain Ind&rsquo;s best forces when facing the horrors that plague its numerous kingdoms with a style that mimics that of a dance on the battlefield. This comes at a great cost and heavily weighs on their soul, as they face endless invasions from the chaotic Hung and vile ratmen below. Their piety and worship to the three Great Gods of the Ind pantheon is all that keeps them sane: Brahmir the Creator, Vaishna the Protector and Shaivi the Destroyer are to the warriors and people of Ind what Sigmar, Myrmidia and Ulrich are to the people of the west.</p>\n<p>To the Rajput to fight is to serve their gods, all of them, in some way: For Brahmire they fight to allow their people to flourish, living their lives in peace to create and cherish the lives given to them by their gods; for Vaishna they fight to protect their lands, homes, people and honor; and for Shaivi they seek to destroy the corruption eating at the heart and soul of Ind, purging it for reasons akin to the Witch Hunters of the Empire.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Indan)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Rajput Warrior Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

No plea for help shall find me wanting. No obstacle will stand before me. No evil will taint the lands bequeathed unto me. When the clarion call is sounded, I will ride out and fight in the name of Liege and Lady. That which is sacrament, I shall preserve. That which is sublime, I will protect. That which threatens, I will destroy, for my holy wrath will know no bounds. Honour is all. Chivalry is all. Rejoice, for we, the Knights of Bretonnia... will be your shield.\"<br />\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&mdash;The combined vows of the Knights of Bretonnia</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bretonnia is a nation that prides itself on the idea of chivalry and honor. Since the ancient human tribes of the Bretonni first set lands in the great country we know as Bretonnia, its people strong an independent from the Empire founded under the great warrior Sigmar. Under their own rulership they built a powerful feudal system with its backbone lying with the numerous noble knights that defend the realm with martial skill and honor in combat.</p>\n<p>Since Bretonnia&rsquo;s unification under the great Gilles and the Companions, there is a near constant call to arms, as Knight Errants pour out of every dukedom ready to serve the Lady of the Lake. The legendary heavy cavalry of Bretonnia is said to share no equal, though many have tried, and through centuries of bloodshed and constant war they have proven time and again to hold true that status. From giant beasts to roaring hordes of Greenskins and Beastmen, it is both an honor and a necessity for valiant knights to fight all horrors in martial combat that seek to challenge them and to give their lives defending the people of the realm of Bretonnia.</p>\n<p>At an early age young pages are picked from the nobility and trained in the art of warfare and swordsmanship. After years of education and training as a squire, they are ready to be granted the status as a Knight Errant, the first line of Bretonnia&rsquo;s defense against evil. They serve their duty proudly, with lance in hand, and after much experience in war, travel and an eagerness to serve the Lady, the lucky few manage to gain the title of Knight of the Realm. These greater protectors of Bretonnia make up the core of the Bretonnian military and serve unquestioningly and are the most common members of the ruling elite, holding their own portions of land to protect with their life.</p>\n<p>However, the most pious, honorable and distinguished knights require more. The most devoted to the Lady take up the Quest for the Grail putting down their lance and swearing never again to raise it until their quest has been complete and they have become the greatest of their Lady&rsquo;s chosen protectors&mdash;Grail Knights. These Questing Knights are those nobles who are seeking the attention of their patron goddess, the Lady of the Lake, in hopes of acquiring her blessing to obtain the status of a Grail Knight. Living a solitary existence, these men strive to prove themselves to the Lady, performing good deeds, slaying foul beasts, and aiding the armies of Bretonnia when in times of peril.</p>\n<p>The quest is long, harsh and brutal, but if succeeded those knights who prove themselves the most pure and worthy drink from the grail given by the Lady, and if they survive, they become her Grail Knights. These Knights are the very pinnacle of Bretonnian chivalry, honor, and bravery. Those Questing Knights who have drunk from the Holy Grail are blessed with the powers of the Lady and have thus been proven worthy to become Grail Knights. To obtain the position of a Grail Knight is the ultimate goal for all knights, and to become one is to be the very embodiment of a holy warrior. It is said that these knights are the greatest of mankind's warriors to walk the earth.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Bretonnian Noble)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Knight of the Realm Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

Many tales tell of raiding ships that have vanished into the mists never to be seen again. Occasionally the gossip in a tavern will turn to the tale of a friend of a friend who was shipwrecked on the isle and returned to tell stories of creatures that were half horse, half man or of terrible one-eyed beasts that stalked the mists. Some even claimed to return with riches beyond a man&rsquo;s wildest dreams.</p>\n<p>No truth to these stories has ever been proven, and the rumors of Albion remain little more than fantastic tales told by drunks to any who would listen. But then a new legend spread across the land. Sailors talked of an island which had suddenly appeared to the far north. Huge white cliffs loomed out from the sea, but the sailors had also spied beaches where a small boat may possibly make a landing. It would seem that the mists had parted, and the land lay open to explore. Every race across the world gathered its armies to seek the treasures of Albion and claim the island as their own.&rdquo;<strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p>Highlanders are the fittest and toughest of the barbarians of Albion&mdash;they must be to contend with the horrors that ravage the sparse human tribes that pepper its tainted and dark lands. Greenskins, Lizardmen, Beastmen and unspeakable monsters are a daily threat to the lives of the people of Albion and only their bravest people muster the strength to face them in combat. They wield stone-age weaponry, forsaking modern convention of armor and firearms due to their people&rsquo;s lack of technological advancement and reliance on their tribal and druidic ways of living.</p>\n<p>These warriors are amongst the bravest of their kind, as they charge into battle against large beasts, mutants and demons wearing nothing but the skin on their back and War Paint enchanted by the druids of Albion said to protect even the deadliest of blows. Lately they&rsquo;ve been venturing out, seeking new lands for reasons only known to them. Often, it&rsquo;s to acquire food, weapons or allies to bring back to their home, and some are even sent on a mystical quest by the tribe druid.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Albion)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Peasant</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Highlander Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

In these tumultuous times their numbers have increased rapidly; they remained a great cause of disorder throughout the land of Nippon and Cathay, becoming mercenaries, guards, bandits and crime lords. They are no less deadly in combat than their noble brethren the Samurai, but their freedom from many of the rules and regulations binding them to their duties from both the Bushido Code and their lords makes them significantly more dangerous to cross. While samurai are certainly capable of their own cruelties and enforce unfair laws against the common people, the Ronin are considered honor-less and need not hold themselves to the same standard.</p>\n<p>In the late-25th century IC many impoverished samurai were attracted to the employment of Western foreigners from the country of Westerland as a chance to restore some of their lost wealth and status. Large numbers of Ronin dissatisfied with their current treatment, or out of boredom, left for these foreign lands spreading to parts of the Empire, Bretonnia, Estalia and Tilea searching for work in various fields. The vast majority end up taking criminal work in some form or another; banditry is common, as is becoming gang enforcers and utilizing their years of training and discipline to climb through the ranks and start their own criminal empires. Those that follow this path are referred to as Yakuza and are the bane of law enforcement.</p>\n<p>Not all Ronin are so ruthless. While many suffer great misfortune, it isn&rsquo;t uncommon for them to perform great acts of kindness. Adventuring and exploration are in their blood as much as any other nomadic warrior of their kind, and tales of bands of Ronin fighting off Greenskin, Beastmen and bandit incursions to protect villages and innocent lives are just as common as their tales of brutality and ruthlessness. In recent years tales have sprung around the Empire and beyond of men and women in strange robes entering towns clearing them of criminals, invaders and hidden chaos cultists asking for nothing more than a cup of tea and a night&rsquo;s rest. The most famous is a man who goes by the name of &ldquo;Jack&rdquo;, a Ronin dressed in white and grey foreign robes, wearing a straw hat; he is said to have slaughtered Beast Lords, Orc Bosses and Skaven Warlords in single combat across Estalia, Tilea and the Empire. He asks for little if anything in return. Despite no one knowing his true name, when a Tilean noble of Miragliano asked him for anything he desired after preventing a Skaven invasion from besetting the city the Ronin merely asked he be given a new name befitting of a local commoner. The people of Miragliano voted and the title of &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; was granted to him for his actions in protecting the mighty principality. It is rumored many of the ratmen&rsquo;s assassins have failed in their attempts to stop Jack&rsquo;s acts of altruism.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Nipponese)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Rogue</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Ronin Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

However, the native human Southlanders are no slouch when it comes to fighting, their Zunu warriors being amongst the fiercest combatants on foot able to chase down their prey with lightning speed for days.</p>\n<p>The organization of the Zunu armies are profoundly different to their professional Empire counterpart, a part-time citizen militia, the means by which a nation of herdsmen come together periodically in national service. At the heart of the system are guilds. These guilds are a means of exercising central control over the most productive element in the group&ndash;its young men and women&ndash;and prior to the emergence of the Southlands Kingdoms thousands of years ago, each chiefdom raised its own guilds.</p>\n<p>Every two or three years, young warriors who reach their late teens are called and gathered together at the royal homestead and form into a unit. They are given a regimental name, told to wear a specific uniform of feathers and furs on ceremonial occasions, with older veterans appointed as officers over them. These units then serve as the chiefdom&rsquo;s labor gang, police force, hunting-parties, and army. Although housed in special settlements while assembled, there is no infrastructure to support them for extended periods, and it is usual for them to disperse and return to their homes when they had performed their appointed tasks.</p>\n<p>Zunu armies are mobilized quickly whenever invading forces come into notice. With the recent rise of the Southland Kings thanks to good relations with the Lizardmen, individual chiefdoms within the Southland Kingdoms have ceased to raise their own guilds, and the right to do so has become the prerogative of the kings. The guilds by 2500 IC number in the hundreds or even thousands of men apiece and are quartered when mustering in their large royal homesteads. A robust military ethic prevails amongst them, jealousy of their honors and distinctions being prevalent, with scuffles between guilds now common.</p>\n<p>Uniformed war-shields were traditionally made using animal hide with weapons brought by the warrior. The long-bladed, thick hafted stabbing spear has remained the favorite for thousands of years. However, by the 2300&rsquo;s IC, due to bettering relations with the Lizardmen, seeing Southlanders as allies as ordained by The Great Plan, Zunu warriors are being increasingly equipped with Obsinite shields, spears, maces and blades forged by Skink Artisan-Priests. Some Zunu have even had the honor of fighting alongside the towering Saurus of the Lizardmen against the innumerable threats of the Southlands, with the most seasoned and battle-hardened receiving gifts and magical trinkets for their service. Some Southlanders even managed to learn and understand the Lizardmen Language of Saurian despite it being unpronounceable to other species.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Southlanders)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Witch Doktor Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

The sun scorched dunes burn with a heat high enough to cook a man to death in a few hours, and water is more precious than gold. Under these conditions it takes a hardy group of people to live in such a harsh environment. These nomads make up the bulk of much of the cavalry at the sultan&rsquo;s command. Hardy and zealous as any priest of Ormazd, these individuals charge across the dunes ambushing, butchering and enslaving their foes with ruthless efficiency. Much like the corsairs of Lashiek, these Desert Riders come from many walks of life: nobles, commoners, peasants and more make up the ranks of the Desert Riders with the nomads and bandits outside the cities making up the vast majority. They also hold a large stake in the Arab slave trade, ambushing and enslaving many travelers, native or foreign, and defending the borders between the Land of the Dead and Araby.</p>\n<p>Desert Riders make up the majority of the light cavalry for Araby with many being taken in to serve in the name of the various caliphs, sheikhs and viziers that rule its cities and territories. While some serve out of a sense of duty, pride or for religious reasonings, the vast majority are simply paid into service. They fight using the terrain to their advantage, able to engage invading forces on their terms with day or night ambushes--hails of arrows peppering their enemies, allowing the rest of their forces to close in and cut down the trespassers. Many Tomb King attempts at conquest and Greenskin warbands have ended at the hands of these brave individuals. Day and night, these experts of the desert sands of Araby are the main shield against the many evils that plague their people. The most famous being the Desert Dogs lead by Al-Muktar, an Old Worlder turned mercenary king after winning over the loyalty of a powerful band of Desert Riders who had initially captured him. Since then he has carved out a reputation as one of the most powerful mercenary leaders in Araby, if not all of history.</p>\n<p>Not all Desert Riders are slavers, bandits and cavalrymen, however. Many seek fortune, travelling across the sands and exploring the ancient tombs and ruined cities of millennia&rsquo;s past. Bel-Aliad, being the most sought after, is the place where most young and ambitious adventurers go to seek their fortune--and many their doom. Its ancient halls and sunken homes are said to hide untold treasures, attracting many to its domain. Desert Riders who enter and live to tell the tail are said to come out with powerful magical artifacts, including swords surrounded by flames, jeweled rings that grant the wearer divine luck and lamps that are rumored to hold the mystical Djinn trapped within them that sell for a fortune to the right magician.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Arabyan)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Rogue</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Desert Rider Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

The skill of some of these duelists is enough to give even a Swordmaster of Hoeth some pause&hellip;\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&mdash;Oralin the Valiant, High Elf Ambassador</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cathay, the great empire of the far east, is the oldest human empire and among the most powerful of the human realms on the planet. Its armies are said to number from the hundreds-of-thousands to the millions, dwarfing its neighbors in raw manpower and overrunning even Greenskins in numerical supremacy. From the capital in Weijin to the heavily defended north of Cathay in Nan-Gau and southern forts bordering the tainted land of Khuresh in Xianbei, the subjects of the Celestial Dragon Emperor fight on a regular basis to defend their homeland from the tainted forces of Chaos. Skaven, Ogres, Beastmen, Greenskins and relentless invasions by the barbaric Hung tribes of the north have tested Cathay time and again for millennia, much like the Empire of man to the West. However through Cathay&rsquo;s many thousands of years of history in art, warfare and magic, they have perfected the ultimate warriors&mdash;the Swordsaints.</p>\n<p>A celestial order defined by their unwavering loyalty to the Emperor, the Swordsaints of Cathay are expert duelists of almost mythical status. Their mastery of the sword has earned them much fear and renown from both their allies and enemies. They train relentlessly, mastering techniques and styles unheard-of outside the East. With decades of practice, preparation and study put into each stroke, their combat prowess is perfected through years of aggressive fighting against the greatest of their enemies&rsquo; champions, with Chaos Warriors of the Hung, Ogre Bruisers and innumerable Greenskin Bosses being but a few examples. Masters of the art cut these foes down relentlessly over their many decades of life, with the greatest of champions granted a personal audience with the mysterious Celestial Dragon Emperor himself, gifted his blessing (not too dissimilar to The Cult of the Lady in Bretonnia) and granted a legendary Jade Longsword forged by the master smith&mdash;the Gold Wizards of Cathay.</p>\n<p>The Swordsaints are nomadic in nature, travelling the lands of Cathay and beyond and aiding the people of the land when they can. They are considered kind and approachable by the people of Cathay, as many of the more prominent Swordsaints are descendants of commoners and peasants who don&rsquo;t suffer the same dissociation with the common people unlike nobility--unusual of an order of such prestige. It is skill and not class that is sought after within its divine order, a similarity they share with the monks within the Mountains of Heaven. Many Swordsaints are remembered through shrines and statues built in their honor for their great deeds and defense of the people with each subsequent saint having a terracotta soldier made in their honor and likeness outside the Emperor&rsquo;s palace in Weijin to protect him&mdash;even in death. In Nippon, the Swordsaints are held in higher esteem among the warrior caste, as it was they who taught the samurai many of the techniques, arts and strategies they now associate with their kenjutsu and Bushido code. Those who follow the older ways of Cathay in Nippon society are known as the Kensai. In recent years, with the bridging of relations between the far East and the outsiders from Marienburg, Swordsaints have started traveling themselves abroad, to new lands not yet discovered, new cultures to explore, new people to defend and new challenges to face.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Cathayan)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Swordsaint Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

Marines protect their ships from pirates, Norse marauders, and other raiders. Unlike seamen, whose primary duty is sailing the ship, Marines are onboard only to fight. When in port, Marines frequently form press gangs to fill out the ship&rsquo;s crew. More than one unsuspecting citizen has awoken at sea after taking a belaying pin to the head from an overzealous press ganger. Due to these activities, and their own drunken brawling, Marines are resented in many seaside communities. When raiders attack, however, these same citizens are quick to accept the aid of battle-hardened Marines.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p>Despite their reputation within the Empire as part soldier and part thug, the word &ldquo;Marine&rdquo; is used as a description for any kind of maritime combatant. Within the lands of Ulthuan, the High Elves house and train powerful maritime warriors known as the Lothern Seaguard, masters of ship-to-ship combat and renown marksman. The Dwarfs of Barak-Varr house the largest fleet within the Dwarfen realms and field powerful sea-savvy warriors to fend off the endless tide of Greenskins from the Badlands and aid in sending ironclad warships to fend off Norscan invaders across the Sea of Claws. Even amongst the Empire there are distinguished regiments of Marines who do not fit the typical stereotype often associated with their rough reputation. The armies of Ostland and Nordland maintain powerful fleets armed with highly trained and respected marine corps, such as the Nordland Seahawks. So, while the typical marine is often visualized as a brutish, war-torn human sailor prone to shady dealings and drunken barfights, the requirements for what truly categorizes a marine is broad enough to encompass a much wider range of brave men and women across the Old World.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human,Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling, High Elf</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Riverfolk</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Marine Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

Burn-burn the robed ones, for they-they have slain us many!&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">--Xan Speartail, Skaven Warlord</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Like many Orientals, Nipponese worship a common god called the Orange Simca, whose monks wear orange robes and spend most of their time in contemplation. Vimto is the martial version of Simcism. Nippon abounds with diverse orders of monks, either martial or clerical. The Orders select their members at a very early age and the chosen ones devote their entire lives to philosophy, theology and the martial arts. A lifetime of grueling study hones their bodies and minds to a very fine edge.&rdquo;&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</p>\n<p>Vimto monks are the warrior priests of Nippon. The naginata is the weapon most often associated with them, though many warrior monks are known to be proficient with everything from bow and arrow to tantō and wakizashi (dagger and short sword). Vimto monks, like most other warrior monks of related sects, wear robes to distinguish themselves from other soldiers and samurai, with a series of white or orange kimono-like robes in layers, one over the other, usually white underneath, and tan or saffron yellow on top. Vimto monks often fold and tie the white head cowl to cover more of their head.</p>\n<p>Finally, many warrior monks wear some form of light samurai armor, usually reinforced leather. The Vimto employ a variety of weapons. The belt of the kimono is often supplemented with a heavier sash, so a sword could be slung from it. The long tachi was probably the most common sword, though many monks may carry tantō as well. Many monks are also accomplished archers. The most traditional weapon of the monk, however, was the naginata. Their ancient enemy is that of the Skaven. Ever since clan Eshin stole the art of stealth and assassination from Nippon and Cathay they have used their abilities to kill many key members in the monk&rsquo;s priesthood. With a lack of leadership, the Skaven thought it would cause the monks to weaken and fracture, possibly fighting amongst themselves like in other religions--but it backfired miserably. The Orange Simca herself is said to have granted visions to her followers commanding them to launch an endless crusade against the Children of the Horned Rat and not to rest until they have been purged from all of Nippon forever.</p>\n<p>Their pious nature is said to grant them valuable gifts from the Orange Simca, Goddess of the Rising Sun, herself, giving them an unparalleled reputation as the living embodiment of the goddess. Seen as avatars of war, Daimyo often pay large sums of money to buy them off as mercenaries either to aid them in their campaigns of war or more commonly to avoid a conflict with them altogether. Ogres find the Vimto monks to be rather difficult competitors in the mercenary market and have launched many failed and bloody attempts to &ldquo;outbid&rdquo; their competition. Many ogre tribes in Nippon have had their contracts taken by the Vimto due to a sudden lack of &ldquo;communication&rdquo; between their employers and the ogres they initially planned to hire.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Nipponese)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Vimto Monk Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

Each patient carries his or her own doktor inside him or her. They come to us doktors not knowing the truth. We are at our best when we give the doktor who resides within each patient a chance to go to work. Southlanders know this too and have mastered the art of doktoring&hellip; to the chagrin of my colleagues.&rdquo;<br />\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&mdash;Dr. Hermann Schleiss, Professor at the Altdorf Physician&rsquo;s Guild</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Witch Doktors are the primary healers in the Southlands. They are treated as both the physical and spiritual manifestations of their gods, The Old Ones. The eldest and wisest of the Witch Doktors are powerful sages capable of healing one par with even the most seasoned Jade Wizards. It is unknown how they managed to harness such potent healing capabilities, but Imperial Scholars theorize it has something to do with the Southlanders proximity to the Lizardmen Kingdoms and the Life Slanns.</p>\n<p>Each chiefdom has its own Witch Doktors. Within the community they are treated as conduits to the gods, never to be harmed or insulted for fear of angering the spirits believed to live with them. Imperial scholars theorize this superstition came from past miscasts from lack of proper training. However, Witch Doktors start out no different than any other healer or doktor found within the Old World. They use traditional remedies and learn crude, but effective, forms of surgery, stitching up wounds and helping the poor with little to no pay for their services.</p>\n<p>Witch Doktors seemingly operate only on altruism, taking the barest minimum earning to live peacefully despite working hard to keep the chiefdom&rsquo;s citizens and warriors in top and healthy shape. It is a fascinating act of human compassion that does not go with earning the respect and admiration of the people they save. By the time they do learn how to harness the Winds of Ghyran, Witch Doktotrs have already proven themselves as capable healers without any magical intervention. Harnessing the Winds is treated as a reward&mdash;a gift from the gods themselves for their service in preserving the lives and calming the spirits of the chiefdoms they inhabit.</p>\n<p>Once they ascend, Witch Doktors are required to take on an apprentice as tradition. Not too dissimilar to the Colleges of Magic, apprentices are chosen after being magically sensed out by the more experienced magic caster. To the people of the Southlands this justifies the belief that Witch Doktors are chosen by the gods with the sages being the living conduits of their divine will.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Southlander)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Academic</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Witch Doktor Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

The cannons are barkin&rsquo; fierce today.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&mdash;Anonymous Artillerist</p>\n<p>&ldquo;These immense guns form the backbone of an artillery battery, hurling solid balls of iron into the enemy, ripping through ranks and devastating formations.

Field repairs are often necessary when a wheel breaks or a gun carriage cracks, and a smart Artillerist quickly learns how to make temporary repairs to ensure minimal interruption in firing rate. Artillerists rely on teamwork and command groups of Engineers to operate their weapons effectively. They are rarely found outside of a large army.</p>\n<p>Part Engineer, part Soldier, and all target, Artillerists must learn to take care of themselves on the battlefield. Generally, they are far enough behind the battle lines to be out of danger, but the effectiveness of their weaponry makes them favorite targets for enemy missile fire, flying creatures, and magical attacks. Also, moving the various engines around is hard work under the best of conditions; over muddy, rutted, rock-strewn battlefields it can be an endurance test with lives hanging in the balance. The career of an Artillerist is not all glory, as is frequently supposed.</p>\n<p>An Artillerist lives and dies on the battlefield by his skill in operating and maintaining his gun. Because of this, an Artillerist is taught to put nothing above the care of his gun. He obsessively cleans and maintains it, practices often and polishes it until it shines. Some Artillerists go so far as to give their guns female names and talk or even sing to them. This has led to most state troop regiments regarding Artillerists as more than a little strange. Of course, as long as the big guns keep firing, they are not going to complain.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human, Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Academics</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Artillerist Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 99.0712%;

The corps was most likely established centuries before the Crusades as elite infantry.</p>\n<p>They began as an elite corps of slaves made up of kidnapped young children who were converted to The Cult of the Great Prophet and became famed for internal cohesion cemented by strict discipline and order. Unlike typical slaves, they were paid regular salaries. Forbidden to marry or engage in trade, their complete loyalty to the Sultan was expected. By the 14th century IC, due to a dramatic increase in the size of the Araby standing army, the corps' initially strict recruitment policy was relaxed. Civilians bought their way into it in order to benefit from the improved socioeconomic status it conferred upon them.</p>\n<p>Consequently, the corps gradually lost its military character, undergoing a process that has been described as &lsquo;civilianization&rsquo;. The Janissaries were a highly formidable military unit in the early years, but after the Crusades in the 15th century IC, its military organization had declined, and the Janissaries became a force of change, subverting their religious dogma and centuries later embracing firearms. Steadily the rest of the Arabyan military power became outdated by comparison.</p>\n<p>The Janissary corps today are distinctive in a number of ways: They wear unique uniforms, are paid regular salaries (including bonuses) for their service, march to music, live in barracks and were the first corps to make extensive use of firearms in Araby. A Janissary battalion is a close-knit community, effectively the soldier's family. By tradition, the Sultan himself, after authorizing the payments to the Janissaries, visited the barracks and received his pay alongside the other men of the First Division, but this tradition slowly eroded as the corps grew increasingly unpopular for preferring and specializing in black powder ranged warfare. They also serve as policemen, palace guards, mercenaries and fire fighters during peacetime.</p>\n<p>The Janissaries also enjoy far better support on campaign than other troops of the sultanate. They are part of a well-organized military machine, in which one support corps prepares the roads while others pitch tents and bake the bread. They campaign with their own medical teams of Araby and Strigany surgeons and their sick and wounded are evacuated to dedicated mobile hospitals set up behind the lines. These differences, along with an impressive war-record, make the janissaries a subject of interest and study by Old World scholars.</p>\n<p>Due to current state of Araby no longer being a unified superpower, and having adopted many foreign tactics and skillsets, many Janissary find themselves seeking work outside their homeland, travelling as far north as the Empire seeking fortune and glory in the name of The Great Prophet.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Arabyan)</p>\n<p><strong>Class: </strong>Ranger</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Janissary Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

They’re bought and sold to military officials, nobles and private orders to place in their armies until either they’ve died or earned their freedom.

Much like their janissary counterparts, the Mamluks of Araby are run through rigorous amounts of education and training, with a structure similar to that of the knightly orders found in the rest of the Old World. Once trained for battle, Mamluks are expected to hold the values and traditions of their order and their faith above all else—to live and die serving as the swords of the Great Prophet is paramount.</p>\n<p>Equally as dangerous on foot as they are on a mount, Mamluks are highly prized elite infantry and cavalry within Araby. Once their masters die or they’ve earned their freedom by other means, Mamluks can often find employment without much, if any, issue. Due to the broken state Araby is in, Mamluks can often be found travelling and selling their services across a wide range of locations, up to and including the Old World. Their adventurous spirit combined with years of training and education make them prime for mercenary work, with some of them returning home relished with newfound wealth and becoming an Amir in their own right. These lords and commanders would in turn continue the cycle, leading great armies, some establishing their own knightly orders and purchasing slaves to be trained and educated as Mamluks under their strict guidance.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mamluk Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width:

They may attend formal schools like the Aquila Academies, or they may receive direct tutelage from officers in the field. Although cadets do learn to fight, the focus of their training is leadership. Some come from noble families, but this is by no means a given. Those who earned a place with battlefield exploits are more respected because they have lived war, not just read about it in books.</p>\n<p>Early each morning a bugle summons the cadets from their barracks for a bout of vigorous exercise around the parade ground. They must then don their uniform and rank up for inspection before they are allowed breakfast. The rest of the morning is occupied by classes, where topics such as the history of warfare, battle tactics and the theory of command are studied, usually taught by officers retired due to injury. The head tutor, known as the Commandant, is often a high-ranking officer, the veteran of many battles.</p>\n<p>Another formation drill precedes lunch, and the afternoon involves more classes to sharpen the mind, followed by rigorous athletic activity and weapon practice to strengthen the body. The cadets are inspected a final time before supper, and evening is reserved for personal study, until lights out at midnight. During important festivals, such as Year Blessing, the evenings involve a formal meal in full dress uniform.</p>\n<p>The cadets' lives are strictly regulated, and discipline is severe, instilling in them a healthy respect for order. Even on Festag, the week's holiday, the college's priest of Sigmar or Myrmidia lectures the cadets on moral fiber.</p>\n<p>A cadet spends three years at college. During the summer month of Nachgeheim, cadets are attached to a regiment. If a cadet is lucky, the regiment will be at war, but experiencing army life firsthand in peacetime is also invaluable to his military education. Many officers find cadets a nuisance and give them ridiculous orders to keep them out of the way, or otherwise amuse themselves playing cruel pranks on them.</p>\n<p>During their final year at college, cadets must study hard to pass their exams. Those that make the grade are commissioned as an officer of the Imperial army and leave the school to join a regiment, an occasion marked with riotous celebrations.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human, High Elf</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Cadet Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

As a result, joining the kossars is seen as a way of cutting their ties and escaping a difficult past.</p>\n<p>The officers accept anyone who can pass the fitness tests, and Tzar Boris granted new kossars a full pardon for any crimes committed before they joined. This pardon does not, of course, apply to crimes committed after becoming a kossar. Contemporary kossars include both Ungols and Gospodars, and they have more than their fair share of criminals, bored younger sons, and general troublemakers. This structure means they have an even worse off-duty reputation than most soldiers.</p>\n<p>Their Boyars do not keep records of the number of kossars executed for their crimes against civilians, as the numbers would be too embarrassing. The Ice Queen would like to restore the kossars pay and increase the size of the army, introducing elements of cavalry. However, many nobles, both Gospodar and Ungol, are very suspicious of any moves to increase the size of the standing army and have encouraged winged lancers and horse archers to see any attempt to include cavalry in the standing army as an insult to their prowess. On the other hand, they are extremely effective in battle, as they are trained constantly and drilled in battlefield tactics and maneuvers. This reputation is also widespread, so a settlement facing imminent attack is always glad to see the kossars but also keen to see them leave again.</p>\n<p>Originally, the Kossars were an Ungol tribe that lived northeast of the Empire. An eastern people known as the Gospodars invaded this region, subjugated the Ungols, and founded the nation of Kislev. During this conflict, the kossars sold their skills to the Gospodars as Mercenaries, fighting against other Ungol tribes. Their unique style of fighting impressed the Gospodar nobility, and since that time Kossar regiments have served the Tzars of Kislev. These days the Kossars are no longer a tribe, but a tough military unit drawn from all over Kislev. They are armed with bows and great axes, making them quite flexible on the battlefield. Many kossars, tired of the ceaseless warfare of their native land, travel to the Empire to become Mercenaries or adventurers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Ungol&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>Gospodar)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Kossar Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

This has led to the establishment of a large Nipponese community in Nipponstaad, between the Paleisbuurt and the Handelaarmarkt, and next to the Cathayans of Zijdemarkt within Marienburg.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p>Samurai are the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of Nippon and have been for thousands of years. They are the well-paid retainers of the daimyo (the great feudal landholders) having high prestige and special privileges such as being granted a high education and wearing two swords. They cultivate the bushido codes of martial virtues, indifference to pain, and unflinching loyalty, engaging in many local battles against rival clans, Greenskins, ogres, Skaven and Daemons.</p>\n<p>As aristocrats for millennia, samurai have developed their own cultures that influence Nippon as a whole. The culture associated with the samurai such as the tea ceremony, monochrome ink painting, rock gardens and poetry was adopted by warrior patrons throughout the decades -160 to -120 IC. These practices were adapted from the Cathayan arts. Celestial monks introduced them to Nippon and they were allowed to flourish due to the interest of powerful warrior elites. The Grandmaster of Heaven at the time was the monk who was advisor to both the Emperor and his close partner, the Shogun at the time, in an attempt to bridge relations between the two great powers. The Grand Master, as well as other monks, served as a political and cultural diplomat between Nippon and Cathay. The Grandmaster was particularly well known for his garden design. The Celestial Monks even brought along Sword Saints from the mainland to help advise and train the warrior caste of Nippon, teaching them the secrets to numerous swords fighting and bladesmith techniques, and their codes of honor.</p>\n<p>However, relations fell apart upon the reveal of an ulterior motive within the courts of Cathay, as sinister forces (rumored to be servants of Tsien-Tsin, also known as Tzeentch) within its political structure attempted to subjugate the island nation, leading to war. The people of Nippon, fiercely determined, united under the Shogunate and fought off a massive invasion spearheaded by Cathay. Through centuries of fighting, Nippon perfected its own craft of swordsmanship and successfully repelled the forces of Grand Cathay in a bloody war of independence.</p>\n<p>The country has since been divided and fractured into competing warring states and has been for many centuries. Since contact was reached with Marienburg, many samurai have found themselves travelling to the far west, into Westerland and Marienburg out of curiosity and a search for wealth, knowledge and power. They bare the mark of their clans and parade in their exquisite armor, a symbol of the pride and honor of the people of Nippon&mdash;an honor they are willing to defend and die for at any cost</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Nipponese)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Samurai Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

Without money the whole operations falls apart. The same can be said for most militaries, but whereas a Middenlander soldier is paid a wage it is reasonable to assume in a time of war most would still lay down their lives to defend their homes till their dying breathe for their honor, duty and loved ones. Not so from a mercenary company whose sole purpose is to profit off of conflict and instability. Coin is the lifeblood of any company worth its salt, and only one member has the courage, knowledge and capabilities to keep the books clean and the men paid&mdash;the Paymaster.</p>\n<p>The Paymaster guards the company&rsquo;s currency with their life&ndash;literally so because they always carry the army&rsquo;s pay chest with them. The pay chest is a heavy, iron-bound, secure-looking affair that the paymaster brings to battle on a cart, pulled by animals such as donkeys or draught horses, with the more seasoned paymasters acquiring tougher animals. Paymasters who have proven themselves to their company are often accompanied by the most elite troops as guards that ride alongside and defend the paymaster&rsquo;s chest with their lives. The cart is provided with a suitably impressive flag that also serves as the army's standard so that the troops can see exactly where the Paymaster is at all times, something they find reassuring.</p>\n<p>Paymasters come from all over the Old World and beyond but are predominantly and most highly paid within the Southern Realms. Lawyers, politicians, accountants, merchants and nobles with a spine are the predominant careers often associated with paymasters, leaving their old lives and using their expertise to make substantially more coin and quench their thirst for adventure and lusts for power. It is often touted that the most important person on the battlefield, aside from the mercenary generals themselves, are in fact the paymaster. They&rsquo;re capable combatants in their own rights, often paying the elite troops and experienced officers larger sums of coin to teach them how to fight more effectively during battle.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human, Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling, High Elf</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Courtier</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Paymaster Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

In fact, don&rsquo;t even look at their face. What you do is a job, and who they are doesn&rsquo;t matter to you. Their friends, dreams, beliefs or personal history are of no concern once they have been judged to enter Morr&rsquo;s portal. When the time comes make the stroke, hit them in the back of the neck with a precise, clean strike, not just with your raw brute strength. It makes it easier to cut them down that way&hellip; and is the least painful for them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&mdash;High Executioner Johann Schlau, lecturing an apprentice hangman for once they become a headsman</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An executioner is an official, often within towns and cities but sometimes villages, who carries out a sentence of capital punishment on a legally condemned person.</p>\n<p>In the Empire, executioners are usually presented with an Imperial warrant authorizing or ordering them to execute sentences on behalf of the court, usually accompanying a bailiff, or magistrate in severe instances. The warrant, sealed in the symbol of Verena, protects the executioner from the charge of murder. In some Provincial militaries, the role of executioner is of grave importance as they carry out the sentences to execute known traitors within the ranks corrupted by the temptations of the Dark Gods. The common look of an executioner in the Empire is a hooded figure, sometimes clad in robes. This is done so members of criminal organizations, cultists and other unsavory individuals not fond of their comrades being beheaded do not identify and attempt retaliation on the executioner for carrying out their duty.</p>\n<p>Many executioners are professional specialists who travel a circuit or region within the Provinces of the Empire, performing their duties, because executions are in high demand in these dark times and wealthier areas are willing to pay favorable amounts of shillings for a well-trained professional. Nothing pleases a noble more than knowing for a fact their enemies are eliminated, be they cultists, criminals, rebels or even political rivals. Within their field, resident executioners also administer non-lethal physical punishments or apply torture. These torturers are highly effective at gathering information on behalf of the Imperial courts, Witch Hunters, wealthy nobles and even some criminal organizations. Their skills at maximizing pain and suffering while preventing their victim from dying outright is invaluable for anyone willing to afford them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the Empire, High Executioners also tax lepers and prostitutes, and control gambling houses. Their mere presence and threatening apparel are enough to test even the hardiest of citizens, and with the law on their side there is very little one can do to oppose them without going through the bureaucratic mess that is the court system. Not that it does much good, as their complaints are usually written off as a refusal to pay taxes. They are also in charge of the latrines and cesspools and disposing of animal carcasses, and many are found to be servants of Morr frequenting his temples and praying in his name before each beheading. While this is not universally the case by any means, it is theorized this worship is a method of coping as a side effect to being surrounded by death on such a regular basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human, Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling, High Elf</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Burgher</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Executioner Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

They remain disguised within regiments of ordinary troops until it is time for them to spring. Once a regiment is engaged in hand-to-hand combat, the assassin throws off his disguise, leaps out of the regiment, and may attack any important figures in the enemy regiment. They can fight unarmed, or with a wide variety of weapons, such as the kusarigama (a sickle on a length of cord or light chain that can be thrown or used as a hand weapon), shuriken or throwing stars, and torinoko grenades (which can be loaded with explosives, blinding flash powder, or confusing firecrackers).&rdquo;&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</p>\n<p>The ninja are stealth soldiers and mercenaries hired mostly by daimyos. Their primary roles are those of espionage and sabotage, although many assassinations are also attributed to ninja. Although they&rsquo;re considered the anti-samurai and are disdained by those belonging to the samurai class, they are necessary for warfare and are even employed by the samurai themselves to carry out operations that are forbidden by the Bushido.</p>\n<p>Despite their roots in Nippon, Ninja have spread widely across the far East, occupying Cathay in equally great numbers and establishing secret conclaves as far as Marienburg.</p>\n<p>In hushed whispers it is rumored these ninjas from Nippon and Cathay are the ones that inspired the culmination of the Skaven Clan Eshin. No one is sure how they accomplished such a feat, but this greatly angered the numerous Ninja clans in the Far East and has led to an intense and never-ending shadow war between the two races with their respective talents.</p>\n<p>Besides organized bands of ninjas, there are many freelance ninjas who offered their services to the highest bidder in the unsettled times across Nippon&rsquo;s history. Crafty leaders in Marienburg sometimes employ ninjas, such as Master Genin Toko who serves Venk Kataswaran of the Golden Lotus, to infiltrate and assassinate rivals, nobles and other threats to their businesses and their country as whole. In order to make sure ninjas within a group are who they should be passwords are used at random. A ninja is supposed to stand whenever they hear the password, and anyone left seated is thus exposed.</p>\n<p>The tactics of subterfuge, ambush and trickery and their use of projectile weapons means that ninjas do not enjoy the high reputation that samurai warriors (perhaps not entirely unfairly) acquire for being chivalrous and courageous. The feeling is mutual, as ninjas and samurai notoriously don&rsquo;t work well together.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Cathayan or Nipponese)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Rogue</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Ninja Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

If one must be forsaken, ‘twill be my soul for yours. Should death come anon, ‘twill be my life for yours. I am given.”<br />\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">—Senodonna, Truthsayer of Albion defending her home from Daemons during Dark Shadows</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Of all the mysteries of Albion perhaps the greatest is the purpose of the enigmatic figures known as Druids. Known as the original sorcerers by the people of Albion, when the Old ones still walked the Earth, they selected a few of the most promising of men and women and taught them many arcane secrets, with the intention that they pass these on and guide mankind to enlightenment. After the disappearance of the Old Ones they have bound chaos to the North with the Ogham stones. During the deterioration the Druids continued to remain in seclusion passing on their secrets in isolation. But with the advent of the Dark Shadows, which occurred soon after the end of the Great War Against Chaos in 2302 IC, they have been forced to take a more active role, guiding their most reliable allies in both the defense of Albion and the oppression of chaos marching to war with their fellow inhabitants of Albion.</p>\n<p>Druids are strange people, red haired, muscular individuals with spiraling blue tattoos and their mystical rods of command, inscribed with ogham signs. They are able and skilled magic users that try to protect the artefacts of the Old Ones. Sometimes they utilize the Giants to move some of the large and heavy Ogham Stones following their visions of fulfilling the great plan of the Old Ones.</p>\n<p>During the Dark Shadows, the Druids braved the perilous crossing over the Great Ocean to seek out noble civilizations. They foretold of great danger should their homeland of Albion fall; the forces that bind the Chaos mists to the northern realms would weaken and in so doing Daemon armies would be able to descend upon the world. To those who would help protect the isle they promised to teach secrets lost to civilization since the disappearance of the Old Ones. Fleets of adventurers and conquerors of all races set sail to the shores of Albion, while the mist and swirling fog around the island vanished, and the events of the Dark Shadows took place. In the end, the Druids and the Forces of Order won.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the events of the Dark Shadows, many of the surviving Druids followed their fallen brethren that fled from Albion to hunt and track them down. They have since travelled all around the Warhammer world and sold their services as Dogs of War to the local leaders of men. They live as hermits, preserving the sorceries of their ancient land through ritual and ceremony, waiting for the day when the mists will rise, and they can return home once more.</p>\n<p><strong>Species: </strong>Human (Albion)</p>\n<p><strong>Class: </strong>Academic</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">Druid Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width:634px;height:32px\"

Greatest duelist in all of Castill!&rdquo;<br />\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&mdash;Manuel Aimar Alvaro Ferran Arturo Roberto Francisco Cesar Ignacio Mu&ntilde;oz III before he was shot</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Clashing of steel is heard in one of the many back alleys of Magritta. It is a common sound, both in the tumultuous bustle of daylight and the gripping standstill of the night, which keeps a lot of very annoyed tenants awake without a way to complain. The reason? A falling out between noble houses, a grievance finally able to meld into ire and wrath, bad blood flowing through and ending in that contest of skill. At some point, the blades stop and the night falls tranquil&hellip; until the next bout begins anew. Such is the way of courtesy once words have stopped echoing.</p>\n<p>Diestros are common within noble Estalian households, often coming from noble blood themselves or adopted during youth from orphanages around the country. It is quite unlike the prestigious lineages to rely on one of their own for such matters, preferring to put a lower member from a friendly family or a &ldquo;fortunate&rdquo; orphan to perform. They are dedicated solely to the study and perfection of the blade, with the sole purpose of defending the honor of their house against any and all attacks. In Estalia, this purpose often translates into the settling of disputes by way of fencing against another Diestro, sometimes to the death if the grievance is grave enough. In other circumstances, they are the last line of defence when guards prove unable to banish a threat.</p>\n<p>Unlike other nation&rsquo;s duelist ranks, Diestros consider themselves nobles and are treated as such within Estalia, considered to be the birthplace of the duel. As such, while one can often be witness to lowborn fights between individuals, referred to ironically as &ldquo;Ri&ntilde;as&rdquo;, they are not considered to be at the level of swordsmanship often seen in a bout between Diestros. Depending on the family lineage, they may be trained by a Fencing Master to become one for the newest heir in due time, but usually one of the many fencing academies provide ample opportunity to hone one&rsquo;s skills. For every Diestro is aware that, should they lose too often and too shamefully, so too will they lose their good fortunes.</p>\n<p>Among the greatest Diestros, people speak of &ldquo;Matasietes&rdquo;, a Killer of Sevens, swordsmen with ability bordering the unnatural, working as teachers or hired help for the most grandiose institutions. They often travel out of the Peninsula, learning as many combat techniques as they can before returning as seemingly invincible opponents, blessed by Myrmidia herself. Experienced fighters ought to beware of facing such an opponent and be sure to tackle them in quick haste&hellip; lest the Estalian be allowed to perform their own dance of death.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Estalian)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Courtier</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Diestro Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

I&rsquo;ve met Witch Hunters with more joy in their eyes than these people&hellip;&rdquo;<br />\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&mdash;Oralin the Valiant, High Elf Ambassador</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Jinyiwei is the imperial secret police that serves the Celestial Dragon Emperor of Grand Cathay. The guard was founded to serve as his personal bodyguards. It has since become an imperial military body split between two divisions. They are given the authority to overrule judicial proceedings in prosecutions with full autonomy in arresting, interrogating and punishing anyone, including nobles for crimes related to the occults of Necromancy and Chaos.</p>\n<p>The Jinyiwei is tasked with collecting military intelligence on the enemy and participation in battles during planning. These agents don a distinctive uniform, with a tablet worn on their torso, and carry a special silvered weapon. Jinyiwei wearing black uniform serve as the Emperor&rsquo;s personal experts on hunting down and annihilating the Jade Blood vampires and their undead legions. Those wearing the red Uniforms serve as hunters of the innumerable Chaos cults found throughout the Emperor&rsquo;s domain and specialize in the purging of Tsien Tsin (Tzeentch) worshippers, especially spell casters. They are highly educated and taught that research and understanding of the occult is paramount to ending the lingering threats to the great eastern power. <em>&ldquo;Know thy self, know thy enemy. A thousand battles, a thousand victories.&rdquo;</em>&mdash;The Jinyiwei&rsquo;s Oath that is taken once they enter service.</p>\n<p>One of the duties of the Jinyiwei is to help the Emperor spy on his subjects. The Celestial Dragon Emperor has recently increased the Jinyiwei&rsquo;s duties, allowing them to inspect his officials at work in the capital city of Weijin, as a massive increase in Tzeentchian and necromantic activity has forced his divine hand. About 40,000 cultists were executed within the first year of the Jinyiwei&rsquo;s increased power, which has prompted accusations of abuse of power within the imperial court. These accusations stopped soon after.</p>\n<p>The Jinyiwei are authorized to overrule judicial proceedings in prosecuting those deemed as enemies of the state, granted with full autonomy in arresting, interrogating, detaining them without trial and punishing them, without going through due process. They are bound to the service of the Emperor and take direct orders from him. They also served as political commissars for the Cathayan armies in times of war. In recent years, with the increased trade between Cathay and Marienburg, Jinyiwei have found themselves sought after by Cathayan merchants, scholars and diplomats as guards to help guarantee safe passage into the Old World for interests of the Emperor and Cathay. They also double as co-diplomats and brokers between the Empire and Cathay, sharing information and knowledge regarding undead and chaotic activity both powers suffer in equal amounts.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Cathayan)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Ranger</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Jinyiwei Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

Conflicts predictably arise, and nowhere is this more prevalent than through honorable duels and trials by combat in her name with mixed results. In Tilea, wrestling is a past-time that stretches back thousands of years of the people&rsquo;s history, with leaders like Lorenzo Lupo claiming to be unbeatable in the ring. Estalians are fans of the eccentric and fashionable who take pride as the birthplace of modern dueling and sporting the finest duelists in the Old World. Deep within the Estalian colony of Santa Magritta in the New World these two cultures mixed as floods of colonists from Tilea and Estalia made their way to the New World, and by the early 1900&rsquo;s the Lustrian Luchador was born.</p>\n<p>The luchadors are predominantly devout worshippers of Myrmidia and champions of honorable combat via wrestling and spectacle. Much like their pit fighter counterparts, luchadors enter into a ring against one or multiple opponents and must battle their way to victory; however, rules and guidelines ensure the general safety of the individuals in the ring, as the purpose isn&rsquo;t so much to spill blood as it is to overcome your opponent by pinning them to the ground using a combination of skill, strategy and brute strength. Luchador rings are square shaped and roped off, unlike the circular pits most seen in the Old World for pit fighters. As are the ways of Myrmidia martial weapons are not allowed in these matches, but loopholes have allowed the use of chairs, debris and other various non-lethal items thrown into the ring to be commonly used by luchadors in an attempt to gain an advantage in a fight.</p>\n<p>Luchadors and their wrestling culture has a strong mixture of performance art and aesthetic iconography, with many luchadors taking on unique themes based on different cultures or religions from across the world. Luchadors sport exotic masks that cover most of their facial features&mdash;these help them to play a character to help excite the crowd and allow the crowd to recognize the wearer. El Hombre Muertos for instance is a legendary Morrian luchador who dresses in black and purple, wears a mask with a skull pattern and cites scripture from the Libro Dei Morti to intimidate his opponents before a match.</p>\n<p>These themes modeled after the eccentric characteristics from the diestros of Estalia combined with the intense wrestling of the Tileans make for a unique and highly popular spectacle for the people of both cultures to enjoy. Its popularity has recently spread to the Old World, with Magritta and Miragliano now housing their own leagues of luchador wrestling, with other species such as Dwarfs, Halflings and even Ogres having begun to participate in the sport. Its popularity has allowed many luchadors to grow extremely wealthy in the process as they win matches and rise through the ranks to earn championship titles and become legends that will be remembered for centuries.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human, Dwarf, Halflinf</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Lustrian Luchador Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

As the sun rises the hunter sets about his work, for he knows that only during the day can he enjoy even the illusion of safety. Combining equal measures of caution and haste, he must gather clues of his prey, telltale signs all the Undead leave in their wake. This can include tracking and gathering gossip or hours of research and study on long dead families and forgotten locals.</p>\n<p>Then, if the day is not over, the hunter will try and corner his quarry while it sleeps. More often, there will be days, weeks, or even years of pursuit as vampires are a canny, intelligent, and illusive foe. This means that at the end of each day, fearful of discovery, the hunter must find a defensible place to hole up and wait with stake and hammer for the dawn. Sleep is found only fleetingly for the vampire hunter, always by day, and usually beneath the rays of the sun. This cycle continues until the hunter is successful, or more likely, becomes the hunted.</p>\n<p>The profession of vampire hunter is not one many choose willingly. They are often driven to it because of something that happened in their life. Often this is revenge for someone slain by the vampire, though there are occasionally other reasons.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Ranger</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Vampire Hunter Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

I simply cannot fathom seeing a man, without armor or a weapon, felling an ogre barehanded. If true, they give the people of Chrace a run for their money.&rdquo;<br />\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&mdash;Oralin the Valiant, High Elf Ambassador</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Among the greatest warriors in the East reside within the Temple of the Celestial Dragon Monks. An ancient and powerful order, the Dragon Monks are masters of unarmed combat. Warriors sometimes journey to the temple seeking training, though very few meet the strict requirements, or even survive their first encounter with a member of the order.</p>\n<p>Established thousands of years ago, so ancient no records can recall an exact date, the order of Monks train rigorously across the Mountains of Heaven of Grand Cathay. Highly disciplined and nearly unbeatable in unarmed combat, the Dragon Monks are amongst the elite fighting forces at the disposal of the Dragon Emperor, called in as his elite anti-infantry force. So effective are these monks in close-quarter combat that even Orcs are rumored to prefer longer reaching weapons when engaging them in a fight for fear of being knocked cold in a single punch.</p>\n<p>While their reputation is one that must be seen to be believed, it nonetheless holds true, with epic retellings of long dead warriors having battled the likes of massive monsters, undead, great demons and even the noble dragons themselves. These legends often become their era&rsquo;s respective Grand Masters of the order, giving future generations access to thousands of years of records on the history of the order, Cathay, and the many legendary techniques perfected by immortalized Celestial Dragon Masters before them.</p>\n<p>The truly masterful monks are said to travel to the highest peaks of the mountains, searching for jade tigers and dragons to fight in a one-on-one duel to the death--the monk walking away a master of the martial arts should they survive such a dangerous encounter.</p>\n<p>Their fighting styles take influence and mirror that of the 8 Winds of Magic, consisting of 8 unique and difficult to master Paths of unarmed combat, some more brutal and destructive, while others grant better self-preservation or precision strikes.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, each style is unique in its own way, testing the monk&rsquo;s abilities to their breaking points and making them nearly unbeatable against anyone foolish enough to challenge them should they complete their decades-long training. It is said an experienced monk can even slay an enemy in one blow to the chest with their palms, rupturing innards and stopping their heartrate altogether. These stories have attracted the interest of some in the Old World&mdash;even seeking this power for themselves.</p>\n<p>In recent history, due to increased relations between Cathay and their new trade partnership with Westerland, monks have started traveling to the unknown lands of the Old World in hopes to seek better knowledge, power or to spread the word of the Celestial Dragon Emperor&rsquo;s divine benevolence. Some simply travel to the Old World for fortune, adventure and exploration, possibly to even establish a new temple and spread their order&rsquo;s teachings.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Cathayan)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Celestial Dragon Monk Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

It is true that most peasants give their primary devotion to the other deities of the Old World. A few peasants, however, are as devoted to the Lady of the Lake as any Grail Knight. As these peasants cannot become Grail Knights or Damsels themselves, they try to be as close as possible to those who have. Damsels of the Lady are more feared than loved by most peasants, and most would drive off any who started following them around, so the vast majority of these peasants join the entourage of a Grail Knight. Such people are known as Grail Pilgrims.</p>\n<p>A Grail Pilgrim, as long as he follows his Grail Knight, accepting the hardships of life on the road, is deemed to be on pilgrimage and thus cannot be seized by his lord. Few join purely for this independence, however, as Grail Knights seek out dangerous places, and the life expectancy of Grail Pilgrims is not long...</p>\n<p>Driven by relentless obsession, these pilgrims collect almost anything that a Grail Knight casts aside, whether it be scrap of ruined armor, clothing, or even discarded food. Such is their burning passion, these religious scavengers will follow their idol through all weathers and lands, exulting in his acts and praising his sparing words.</p>\n<p>It has been known for these desperate peasants to mistake gravely wounded knights for dead - indeed it does not stretch credibility to believe that more than a few Grail Knights could well have met their demise as a result of being crushed by scavenging pilgrims. To such a zealot the most prized of all the possessions of a Grail Knight is his body itself. In fact, many bands of pilgrims cart around a Reliquae wherever they go, with the corpse of a departed knight resting at its center. The outside of the reliquae is a gaudy m&eacute;lange, adorned with trinkets gathered from many Grail Knights from across all corners of Bretonnia.</p>\n<p>Often, peasants in the crowd will choose to join the ragtag band of pilgrims, drawn by promises of salvation and the blessing of the Lady. Others are drafted into the ranks through threats and near blackmail, generously being offered an opportunity to earn the redemption of the Lady for crimes and misdeeds that are sometimes real but, more usually, invented by the fanatical preachers who are ever eager to expand their flock through any means. Battle Pilgrims are the fanatical worshippers of the knights from which they derive their namesake. They are furious warriors, utterly dedicated to their patrons. A ramshackle band of zealots, Grail Pilgrims make up for what they lack in skill with fury and righteous fire.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Bretonnian Peasant)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Grail Pilgrim Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

There is no &lsquo;failure&rsquo; only success. A lost catch is a lost tribe.&rdquo;<br />\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&mdash;Ingvar Redwave, Norse Whaling Captain</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Of the few honest trades most common amongst the Norscan people, nothing is more harrowing and dangerous than that of the Whalers.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Norscan Whalers are not just typical hunters; they are also well-abled warriors. Since whaling is an important trade for Norsca, Whalers are respected even among the warriors due to the extreme dangers of the waters surrounding Norsca. Swimming through the dark currents of the Sea of Claws are massive whales, many of which bear strange markings, and odd coloration, twisted and warped as they are by the power of Chaos. These monsters can capsize ships and swallow hundreds of men in a single gulp. Thus, Whalers must be made of sterner stuff than ordinary fishermen.</p>\n<p>Whales provide not only meat but also blubber which can be processed into oil for fuel. Not an ounce of a whale is wasted: the skin is used to manufacture rope, the gullet to make shoes, and the stomach used as floats. Even the lungs and intestines are eaten. Demand from Imperial cities for whale oil to fuel streetlamps has made whaling a very profitable venture.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to hunt these creatures is for whalers to embark in rowing boats and herd schools of small whales ashore where they can easily slaughter them. However, there is no honor in such methods, and Norsemen prefer the thrill of setting sail in a longship to chase the giant whales that plough the ocean. Many young men join such expeditions; it is the custom in many settlements that a girl should spurn a suitor who has not killed his first whale. A captain is careful to vet his crew, due to the belief that whales will attack boats crewed by dishonorable men.</p>\n<p>Norsemen relish the danger of hunting these monsters. When a whale is sighted, the rowers speed their vessel towards it. Harpooners gather at the prow and, when in range, hurl their weapons at their quarry. The bravest men leap from the boat onto the whale&rsquo;s back, thrusting their spears deep into its flesh before swimming back to their vessel.</p>\n<p>A skewered whale can easily capsize a longboat or tow the vessel by the harpoon lines until it shudders apart. Its tail can sweep a man overboard, where he will be swallowed whole in its maw. Few ships return home with a full crew. The harpooners must ensure a swift kill &ndash; the best can pierce a whale&rsquo;s heart with a single throw. If this is impossible, whalers aim to embed their harpoons in the monster's ribs, enabling the crew to drag it to the ship&rsquo;s side where they can kill it with hooks and skewers.</p>\n<p>A whaling vessel will not return to shore unless it is towing a slaughtered whale. Whalers prefer a watery grave to the dishonor of returning empty-handed. When a whaling ship does return after a successful hunt, the gods are praised and celebrations continue for many days, for the survival of the settlement is ensured for the next few months.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Norscan)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Riverfolk</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Whaler Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

Far from unified it is home to innumerable tribes of barbaric Norscans, as bloodthirsty against their southern enemies as they are to themselves&mdash;butchering for the Dark Gods and raiding the coasts for wealth and glory. But not all Norscans are so hostile. Farther to the southern end of Norsca lies the southern tribes and across the Great Ocean to Lustria lies the colony of Skeggi; much milder than their northern kin, these warriors live their harsh lives more as people, traveling, trading and selling their services for supplies, food, coin and, most importantly, adventure. The most common of these are the freeholders, men and women whom through service to their jarl have been granted freedom from their status as bondsman&mdash;slave warriors and workers.</p>\n<p>Because of their status as travelers and traders, many Norscan freeholders have regular contact with Empire and Kislevite merchants. Norscans will often hire themselves out as mercenaries, and as such are highly respected and feared warriors. These will often have contacts with mercenary captains, minor nobles and officers within the standing armed forces of areas in which they serve. Giants of men and women they are very popular within the province of Westerland as their physique and experience as fine fighters and excellent sailors makes them the perfect defense against enemies on land and sea alike. Their fees are high, but their results speak for themselves. They even have a district in Marienburg dedicated to them--living and trading furs, fats and treasures in Norse Town.</p>\n<p>Mercenaries that live long enough return to their people as heroes known as &ldquo;Huskarls&rdquo;, great warriors unmatched in strength and skill as the elite of their people. The greatest of huskarls become jarls in their own right after years of fighting, gathering wealth and experience.</p>\n<p>However even the southern tribes are still worshippers of Chaos at heart, and many still fall under the gods in a lust for power and glory, gathering their strength and launching horrific raids on the southerners from the coasts of Tilea, Araby and Estalia up to the lands of Bretonnia and the Empire. It is true Norsemen pay tribute to the Dark Gods, but to say they are unblinking slaves to the Ruinous Powers is simply false. The Norsemen see themselves as honorable, strong, mighty and courageous, and for these virtues they thank the Gods. They are explorers, adventurers and champions, and those of the Southern tribes take pride in their rich culture, history and traditions enabling trade and commerce with the very southerners they war with regularly. Like all human civilizations, Norscans are complex and diverse.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Norscan)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Freeholder Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

The crossbowmen loosed bolt after bolt, and many fell, but still the howling fiends ran up the beaches with no care for armor or shields. They looked like rabble, but fought like daemons, crashing through our lines, butchering men left and right, clubbing limbs into gore and hacking heads from bodies like they were attached with butter. I'll never forget that morning...&rdquo;<br />\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&mdash;Account transcribed from an Ostland sergeant, 2517 IC</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The life of a reaver is tightly woven to the ship he works on, and the long days often start as the reavers guide the vessel through the fierce northern seas. Breakfast is gulped down in a corner that gives some protection from the wind, and normally washed down with strong spirits to keep a fire in his belly. Unless some prey is sighted, the day continues as it began, until the reaver has the chance to eat an evening meal and tie himself in to grab some sleep. However, once a suitable target is spotted, whether it is a ship or a coastal village, everything changes. The reavers quickly bring the ship around to fall upon their target at full speed, seeking gain the element of surprise and overwhelm their opponent quickly. As they approach, the bare minimum of men are assigned to continue crewing the vessel, while everyone else gears for battle and readies weapons.</p>\n<p>When the ship comes close, reavers leap from their deck straight into the action, charging in with battle cries and cutting down any who stand in their way. Even those who try to flee are chased down; reavers enjoy their bloody work and seldom leave survivors. Once everyone is dead, or fled, the reavers gather their loot. Valuables are stored in the hold of their ship, while food and drink is consumed in great celebratory feasts. The crew sets out again from land, out of the reach of those who might seek revenge. Once back on the seas, many of the reavers who participated in the raid drink themselves into a mighty stupor, which may last until the next raid.</p>\n<p>The practice of slavery is as old as Humanity, originating in the ancient empire of Khemri, and continued through the various civilizations that rose and fell in the intervening years, leading to the present day. In an evolving economy, slavery is simply impractical. In places like Bretonnia, serfs perform all the work and live lives little better than slaves, but in the Empire, men and women, whilst Peasants, are in charge of their own destinies. Of course, in some remote corners of the Old World, the practice flourishes. Araby is famed for its flesh markets as is Sartosa and even some dark corners in Marienburg. The Norsemen take slaves as well, either from surrendered adversaries or as plunder from one of their raids. Occasionally, they have reason to traffic with unsavory flesh dealers, and some enterprising Norsemen take up the profession. Norscan Warleaders are proven Norsemen warriors who&rsquo;ve seen countless battles and are entrusted by their Jarls and Kings to lead detachments of other warriors and Marauders against their enemies. Typically, Warleaders bear many strange tattoos, ritual scars, and most, if not all, have one or more mutations, showing they have the favor of the Gods.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Norscan)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Riverfolk</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Reaver Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

They are charged with the protection of property and public order, and the investigation of all crimes that occur on land. They are also empowered to administer spot justice in small cases such as public drunkenness, disturbing the peace and breaking ward laws. Such matters are usually dealt with by the sergeant of the local Watch house, with punishments ranging from a small fine (no more than 5 Gu) or a night in jail, to a few hours in the stocks or even up to ten lashes if the sergeant is in a particularly bad mood.</p>\n<p>The Black Caps are organized into Watch Barracks, one for each named district in the city except for the foreign ghettos, which are under the jurisdiction of a barracks in a neighboring area. The size of each barracks varies from ward to ward, depending on the area covered and its local character. Small, relatively peaceful areas like Schattinham have a correspondingly small presence, while Suiddock rates the largest Watch presence in the City and a barracks that looks more like a fort. Headquarters is in a large building in the Palace District near the High Court. Typically, though, each barracks is left to handle its own affairs. Ward Captains only request help from headquarters when a case requires specialized investigators or resources.</p>\n<p>Watch Posts are placed at strategic points in each of the city's districts. Each post is manned by anywhere from four to twelve Watchmen, depending on the Ward Captain's judgement. The staff of each post are responsible for patrolling their area and enforcing any laws and bylaws, referring serious crimes to higher authorities. In some areas, these patrols are supplemented by citizen volunteers who help by lending numbers to the Watch patrol and acting as impartial witnesses. In poor quarters like Suiddock or the foreign quarters, anyone doing this is seen as little better than a traitor and a spy and had better not be caught alone near a convenient canal.</p>\n<p>The Black Caps also form the core of Marienburg's militia. Dating back to the patriotic fervor that followed the expulsion of the Bretonnians, the law requires that each ward shall provide a certain number of volunteer crossbowmen to fill out the ranks of the Watch in times of emergency. Since the secession, though, the city has come to rely on mercenaries and the alliance with the Sea Elves, and the Watch's militia roles have been allowed to atrophy until its monthly crossbow drills are little more than social events and contests.&rdquo;<strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Wastelander)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Burgher</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Black Cap Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

With nature and man being so closely intertwined it is no wonder that over the ages many have attempted to tame these creatures. Perhaps it was for the fame and glory, the power of controlling such beasts, or something more benign and simpler as building a friendship with nature itself. The intentions of the Beast Tamers are as varied as any other profession, but one thing is clear&mdash;they are among the few who can successfully control nearly any creature once they&rsquo;ve fully peaked and mastered the art of taming.</p>\n<p>Best Tamers can be found in a large variety of locations. They serve as entertainers, warriors, scouts, hunters and so much more for their respective kingdoms. Those of higher status and renown are often invited to the courts of the many nobles and rulers of the various kingdoms of Ind, to display their talents and their animal companions with compensation afterwards. The warrior Beast Tamers ride in to battle on their various mounts, leading ferocious charges that break the lines of enemy armies, routing and ensuing fear and terror into the hearts of those who&rsquo;d dare stand in their way. Lavished in gifts of gold and silk, Beastmasters represent the pinnacle of the skill a Beast Tamer can achieve having gained control of a mighty monster capable of being broken and mounted.</p>\n<p>Kislev has priests of Ursun capable of taming bears. The Empire has its legendary Demigryph knights. Bretonnia has its Hippogryph and Pegasus knights. Ind has its war elephants. Little is known about their exact methods but is said some Beastmasters go so far as to control manticores and even dragons.

I miss the thrill of hopping on to a ship to plunder and challenging the crew to a duel for their freedoms! &hellip;Now, they simply run and hide, and I grow bored&hellip;&rdquo;<br />\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&mdash;Abd Al Wazaq, Legendary Corsair and Pirate King of Sartosa in the 16th Century IC</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The sea holds many dangers in these dark times, from sea monsters to dark elves and pirates&mdash;both living and dead. Amongst all the blood, plunder and chaos lies another devil of the high seas, the infamous and legendary corsairs of Araby. While Al-Haikk might be the city of thieves, it is the port city of Lashiek, home to the sultan, where these fiendish dogs of the sea originate. For thousands of years these corsairs dominated the slave trade, from the Black Gulf to the coastal towns along the Great Sea and the Sea of Claws.</p>\n<p>Corsairs are amongst the finest elites on the lands and seas around Araby. Both sailor and warrior, these men and women are considered unmatched duelists able to cut down most sailors and privateers foolish enough to stand against them. From nobility and former military ranks all the way down to the commoners and peasantry of Araby, many peoples fill the ranks of the corsairs--thirsty for coin and danger. Even the might of the Imperial and Bretonnian Navies aren&rsquo;t enough to subdue them, as their expert seamanship and lightning fast ambush tactics make them nearly impossible to respond to after a merchant vessel or astray patrol ship is sacked, stripped of all it&rsquo;s worth and its crew enslaved.</p>\n<p>The corsairs of Araby have a long and bloody rivalry with the pirates of Sartosa, and for countless centuries they&rsquo;ve been in a stalemate for control of the high seas. These pirate wars reached their height around the 13th century IC as large portions of Sartosa itself was conquered and controlled by the Arabyans for centuries. The Sartosans eventually drove off their invaders, but this was partially due to a rise in Norscan and Dark Elf competition around the Tilean sea, forcing the corsairs to fight against no less than three powerful rivals at one time. Nonetheless Araby is still the reigning power of the slave trade in the south, raking in a massive sum of wealth for themselves and the economy of Araby. From the port of Lashiek lies the heart of the slave trade and the main domain of the many pirate lords and guilds, all under the protection of the sultan himself. The best corsairs are said to have captured and sold hundreds-thousands of slaves within their lifetimes.</p>\n<p>As part of a deal with the sultanate, the corsairs swear never to attack an Arab vessel, pay the sultanate a portion of their earnings and to fight on the sultan&rsquo;s behalf for many naval conflicts that threaten Araby alongside its existing navy. This agreement has been honored for thousands of years and it has offered the corsairs protection from their seafaring enemies, immediate access to the Arab slave market, amnesty from the state for their acts of piracy and allies within the professional Arabyan navy that guards the waters around Araby&mdash;although many naval personal are themselves former corsairs or become corsairs. For this the corsairs are both nefarious devils of the sea to much of the Old World and are respected and cherished among many people in Araby. They&rsquo;re so good at their job they are often hired by Marienburg merchants as guards and escorts through the dangerous waters they travel, or as personal bodyguards when docking on foreign lands.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Arabian)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Riverfolk</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Corsair Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

In Norsca, however, Seers are valued members of a Jarl's entourage, reading the signs and portents in the entrails of their sacrifice or translating the flickers of fire to divine some glimpse of future events.</p>\n<p>A seer is a useful source of information, ranging from arcane matters to mundane occurrences. As such, they are in constant demand by people of all walks of life. Seers often accompany the retinue of a jarl. If a jarl has had a weird dream, witnessed a star falling from the heavens, or experienced any other portent, he will approach his seer for an interpretation of the omen.

To weed out those who might come with trivial questions, seers often dwell in remote locations; only the most persistent will bother making the journey. The gifts that visitors bring sustain the seer in food, drink and clothes. A few seers see themselves as prophets, speaking for the gods, and travel from settlement to settlement preaching about the omens that they have seen. However, when their words warn of doom and woe, they quickly outstay their welcome and are often driven into the wilderness by an angry mob.</p>\n<p>Some seers take up a wandering lifestyle, travelling between farms and villages to offer their esoteric services in return for food and shelter; for example, they might divine the future of a farmer's crop or the success of a trader's impending voyage. They also present themselves at the birth of a child and search it for marks that betray the gods' favor... or displeasure.</p>\n<p>The Vikti are the healers and local shamans for most Norscan tribes. Admittedly, most Norseman spellcasters are Sorcerers, Witches, and Warlocks. All of these mystics draw their power from the Dark Gods channelling Dhar to suit their needs. Still, in some parts of Norsca, an older tradition remains: one placing emphasis on divination, healing, and prophecy. Whilst most include them in the pantheon of corrupt Daemonologists, Vitki are not blatant servants of the Ruinous Powers, and instead work their magic to aid their people.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Norscan)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Peasant</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Norscan Seer Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

I'm sorry; Sasha doesn't know his own strength sometimes. Please believe that I will learn what you&rsquo;re hiding from me; when I do, our next meeting will not be so pleasant.&rdquo;<br />\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&mdash;Anonymous Chekist</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The Chekist of Kislev are the Tzarina's secret police. Their existence is not secret, and they have a lot of open members, but they also have spies searching for signs of corruption and opposition to Katarin's rule.</p>\n<p>The chekist are&mdash;by decree of the Tzarina&mdash;infallible in their interpretation of the law. Whatever they say the law is, is the law, and the penalties they select are always appropriate to the crime in question. They never convict the wrong people, and while they may arrest and torture people who prove to be innocent, that is no fault of the chekist.</p>\n<p>The most important qualification for becoming a chekist is absolute loyalty to the Tzarina, which is closely followed by competence. Katarin does not want to institute a reign of terror; she just wants to be able to deal with her enemies quickly and efficiently. Chekist who display excessive cruelty and incompetence are arrested by their superiors and soon become even more closely acquainted with the furnishings of the interrogation rooms. The simply incompetent generally die in the course of their duty, without any assistance from their superiors.</p>\n<p>Chekist who are sadistic but competent pose the biggest problem. In most cases, they are rotated around the country, so that no single area suffers too much from their depredations. Often, they are assigned to deal with very dangerous threats because the hierarchy would rather lose a difficult chekist than one who fits in perfectly.</p>\n<p>The chekist carry an elaborate, minted medallion identifying their position and show it if required to prove who they are. They wear black when on duty but have no formal uniform beyond that, making it relatively easy to pose as a member of the secret police. The chekist deal with anyone who pretends to be one of them, which is another task frequently assigned to those who are both sadistic and competent.</p>\n<p>Checkists have no official, structured organizations to speak of, save in their devotion and duty to the Tzarina herself. They rule through fear and intimidation &ndash; not qualities one seeks in a friend or drinking companion.</p>\n<p>Very few men can take the strain of such constant vigilance; many chekist agents retire from the ranks after only a few years of active service. The ruthlessness necessary to do their job doesn&rsquo;t come naturally for everyone, and only a few individuals truly have the utter lack of compassion and unthinking dedication to their Queen that allows them to forget the pain and suffering they inflict on individuals &ndash; some of them innocent of any crime &ndash; for the good of the State.</p>\n<p>Because of their connections to the chekist organization, as well as the many skills they honed while in the Tzarina&rsquo;s service, retired chekists are highly sought-after by all of the crowned heads of the Old World. For the same reasons they are also prized by the criminal underworld and can command fat salaries if their reputation is fearsome enough.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Ungol or Gospodar)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Ranger</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Chekist Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

This island is a notorious haven for criminals, harboring all manner of pirates, brigands, lawless mercenaries and anyone wanting to avoid the various legitimate powers of the Old World. It is a tremendously dangerous place, where drunken pirates press-gang unsuspecting individuals, brawls and duels are an hourly occurrence, and thieves ply the dirty, crowded docks looking for easy marks. Despite the risks, however, it is a place where someone with the toughness and willpower to survive can not only live but thrive, far from the yoke of unfair taxes, overbearing noblemen, and stringent laws. From Sartosa to Araby in the south, the Border Princes to the East, and the mainland past the Great Ocean, exotic lands await. In short, Sartosa is a perfect place for finding fame, plunder and endless adventure.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p>The pirates of Sartosa are amongst the most infamous threats on the high seas, standing neck-and-neck with the Dark Elf and Arabyan corsairs of Sartosa&rsquo;s east and south respectively, and the Norscan raiders to the far north. They loot and pillage patrolling merchant ships, seizing cargo and making off with small fortunes on a routine basis. Sartosa itself has suffered many invasions from foreigners over the millennia it has existed and come out on top each time through grit and blood. Ironically, the pirates of Sartosa enforce a strict Pirate&rsquo;s Codes, preventing deserters, cheaters and other scallywags from endangering the crew:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Everyone shall obey orders from the Captain and their officers.</li>\n<li>A crewman has the right to defend themselves and their honor.</li>\n<li>A crewman can challenge another to a fair duel, but the challenged gets choice of weapons. No other person can interfere in this duel until one crewman is dead or relents.</li>\n<li>Booty will be shared out as follows: 1 share to every ordinary seaman; 3 shares to the captain; 2 shares to the master carpenter, boatswain, and gunner.</li>\n<li>Anyone caught attempting to desert will be marooned. They may take only a weapon and a bottle of water.</li>\n<li>Anyone being lazy or failing to clean their weapons will lose their share of the booty.</li>\n<li>The punishment for hitting a crewman is 40 lashes on the bare back.</li>\n<li>Everyone may vote on every important decision.</li>\n<li>Everyone may have a share of captured drink and fresh food.</li>\n<li>Anyone found stealing from another member of the crew will have their ears and nose slit open and be set ashore.</li>\n<li>The penalty for bringing a lover aboard in disguise is death.</li>\n<li>No one may leave the crew until each crewman has made 500 GC.</li>\n<li>No crewmember may fraternize with Wizards or other dealers of the Dark Arts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While most pirates work with a crew, it&rsquo;s not uncommon to see many of them strike it rich on their own, as mercenaries or privateers, before fully investing in a crew and ship to avoid the penalties for leaving a crew early&mdash;though many do so anyways if the captain is incompetent or the pay is weak.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human, Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Riverfolk</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Sartosan Pirate Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

Many if not all of these Militias are outfitted with a motley variety of weaponry and armor that are more often than not provided by the individuals themselves. On rare occasions, some of these Militia groups consist of retired grizzly veterans who have left the military and settled down in a peaceful life many years ago, and it is their wisdom and courage that has held many Militia regiments together.</p>\n<p>Most of the time however, these regiments consist of inexperienced villagers with little to no combat training and can only be readily identified by only a few scraps of tatty clothing, which may sometimes have a resemblance of a uniform of some kind, and often incorporate elements of the state's official colors. Equipped with mostly makeshift armor and weapons, which will include assortments such as bows, spears, swords, clubs, and particularly in rural communities, simple farming equipment like pitchforks or grain-scythes, these militias are often looked upon with distaste by many Empire Generals, and seldom use them in the battlefield. Though their lack of conviction for a cause can be questionable, especially during a campaign that these men have little to no business in being in, when the armies of the Empire's foes invades the lands of the Empire, their lack of conviction can grow into zealous devotion in their efforts to ensure that their homes and families shall not suffer a horrifying fate.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling, Human</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Peasant</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Free Company Militiaman Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

None could decipher how this occurred. A true tragedy had befallen the Bretonnians as their champion lay breathless&mdash;the crowd cheering from the stands as the sultry beauty herself, Lucrezzia, kissed the tip of the lance of the victor, infuriating the knights.

No better example of this can be found outside the republics and principalities in Tilea and the Border Princes, where poisonings and power grabs are as common as breathing in the everyday lives of their nobility and political representatives. Who carries out these deeds? Well, when you need someone with finesse, you contract someone with equal parts class and quality&mdash;the Assassins.</p>\n<p>From the port city of Remas to the fortress city of Miragliano, just about any territory was home to these expert killers. From humble beginnings they started out as independent contract killers, no different from the protagonists of the Empire and beyond, offing mercenary officers and lesser nobility for their rivals; however, as the political game evolved, so too did the strategies of the assassins. Private security was getting tougher, guards were more prepared, nobles were leaving themselves far less exposed in public places, and the super wealthy and influential started living in fortress mansions designed to fight off small armies. Something had to be done, and the assassins kept finding a way: smooth talking the relatives and family of the victims for weaknesses and information, bribing guards, disguising as servants and even night time assaults while they slept, sneaking in under the cover of dark became the new methods of murder&mdash;and have been quite successful.</p>\n<p>Assassins guilds began to surface housing across all of Tilea, and over the course of centuries into the neighboring lands of Estalia, Bretonnia, Sartosa, Araby and the Empire as well. These foreign headquarters are run and operated by members of their respective local population. There is much variety in the different sects from the Ḥashashiyan of Araby to the Hermandad de Asesinos in Estalia, but they nonetheless follow the same methods of assassination. Their weapons are unique and varied amongst each other, and their connections with foreign sects make it easier when traveling to gather information and equipment when taking contracts that require crossing borders. Not all assassins follow the guilds, as many members found it more profitable to take on independent ventures, some even starting their own assassination enterprises and spreading their teachings and methodology to the highest bidder.</p>\n<p>The most famous assassin of them all is none other than Lucrezzia Belladonna, a woman of such beauty and power it is said she might be the most beautiful woman in all of the Old World&mdash;and is as deadly as she is beautiful. She is rumored to be the one who poisoned the legendary Borgio the Besieger along with over half a dozen of her former husbands, and has on more than one occasion embarrassed no shortage of Bretonnian knights challenging claims towards her beauty, with many a jousting matches running a foul with knights slumping over dead not long after being hit by the opponent&rsquo;s lance.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human, Halfling</p>\n<p><strong>Class: </strong>Rogue</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Assassin Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 99.0712%;

Some are pious men who are mere soldiers, fighting alongside the armies of templars and knights, and their deeds are no less noble despite their lesser status.</p>\n<p>Although crusades are usually declared by a religious order, many of the knights who join them are driven by worldly motives like revenge or the pursuit of glory.</p>\n<p>Crusaders from the Empire typically belong to Sigmarite or Ulrican orders such as the Knights Panther or Knights of the White Wolf. Crusaders from the southern lands of Estalia and Tilea are almost entirely from the Myrmidian Order of the Righteous Spear. Bretonnian crusaders fight on behalf of their liege lords and the Lady of the Lake, rather than belonging to organized knightly orders.</p>\n<p>The lands north of Kislev have become a popular destination for crusaders from across the Old World since the Storm of Chaos. Crusades are costly endeavors, often requiring significant investment from nobles and merchants. Religious orders lacking the resources to supply ships and baggage trains themselves must guarantee treasure or parcels of land to potential financiers. Wealthy benefactors who wish to have their interests properly represented provide soldiers led by knights from their own armies, or even accompany the crusade in person.</p>\n<p>Within the Empire, the Cult of Sigmar is the only religious order with sufficient wealth to launch a crusade without the backing of others, although the temples&rsquo; coffers would be depleted by such an endeavor, so the patronage of nobles is generally solicited.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Crusader Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

We have a duty to truth, to expose it, ugly as it may be, to render it into submission. Lies come In many a form, from the dejected corruption of an official to the taint of the dreaded mutation. And by Myrmidia&rsquo;s Grace and Wisdom, all who seek to sully her teachings will face our judgment. We are her Arms, her Eyes and her Ears. We are the true protectors against lack of belief.&rdquo;<br />\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&mdash;Laurenzo Taurquema, Gran Inquisidor</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Estalia is a region dominated by belief. It is well known that above the will of kings and their laws, Myrmidia&rsquo;s teachings hold sway for all that wish to live within the many Kingdoms, Baronies and Dukedoms. And to uphold these teachings, the Church of Myrmidia early on formed an organization capable of enforcing such power. La Inquisici&oacute;n was a body of devotees holding great sway in Estalia, ensuring the teachings of Myrmidia would come through all strata of society where possible.</p>\n<p>It gained significant power during the reconquering efforts, with Inquisitors joining the armed hosts of Estalia against the invading forces and acting by way of political officers. After the reconquering efforts started to refocus, so did the way the Inquisici&oacute;n sought to hold sway over society. The Inquisition Schools of Magritta were born out of this necessity, to form specialized members in order to tackle increasingly complicated issues both in Estalian interior and exterior politics. The major lingering threat of Skaven has been a constant issue to Estalia&rsquo;s people for centuries, and the efforts of the Inquisidors has been vital to stemming the tide of endless rat men. Many Skaven slaves, clan rats and stormvermin have met their end at the blade of these expert rat killers. Deus Myrmidia!</p>\n<p>From the fighting in the borders to the courtrooms; dealing with the influence of Chaos and diplomacy; these men became the middlemen for almost all aspects of Estalian society. It is stated that at one point, royally appointed judges got ousted by members of the Inquisition for giving out a contrarian verdict.</p>\n<p>The most famous of these Inquisidores goes by Laurenzo Taurquema, who some say controls the kings of Estalia like they&rsquo;re puppets in his grand schemes. And who can say? While not completely closed to the world, the workings of Estalian laws and doctrine are held close like a secret better left buried. And one can only imagine how these individuals, trained since birth and being taught all the ways the men can be broken, would react to a world broken in faith.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Estalian)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Ranger</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Inquisidor Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

{"_id":"sMcpz0qmPATlfkzy","name":"Almogavar","content":"<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Almogavar</h1>\n<p>The Estalian common folk are accustomed to war. Ever since the evil Caliph Jaffar invaded their land, Estalian shepherds found few options for survival within the harsh mountains bordering Brettonia and Tilea. The easiest one became that which their forefathers had been forced to by the previous kings and nobles: That of raiding and pillaging. And soon after, there was not a single Estalian shepherd that had not grown up sullying his blade once. Estalian Almogavars (a term coined by the Arabyans, meaning &ldquo;Rioters&rdquo;) became an essential part of the reconquering efforts by the Estalian kingdoms, often employing these warbands as mobile light infantry to supplement their own rigid formations. These men came from all walks of life and joined a &ldquo;Compa&ntilde;ia&rdquo;, lead at first by charismatic or veteran individuals with tactical knowledge. These took part in battle by harassing the enemy position with well-placed javelin throws and forcing encounters with enemy infantry on uneven terrain. Outside of battle, their pillaging expertise put the tales of Tilean raiders to shame, destroying the ability for the Caliph to retain his stranglehold on the Peninsula. After these reconquering efforts began their decline, these men became mercenaries in a similar vein to those found in Tilean society, still serving the many remaining baronies, duchies and kingdoms within Estalia and fighting their battles. Their composition became much more professional, the &ldquo;Compa&ntilde;ias&rdquo; forming their own sense of identity and unity amongst themselves and in-between. The leaders of these groups, now known as &ldquo;Adalid&rdquo;, became lower noblemen within Estalian society, capable of fielding a military power that, while not threatening to major stability, could cause major damage. These mercenaries found themselves travelling far beyond the reaches of Estalia and Tilea, wandering over the northernmost icy forests of Kislev, the quibbles and disputes of the Border Princes, the silky sands of Araby and the fearsome jungles of the New World. While bound to their lieges and their kingdom first, these &ldquo;Compa&ntilde;ias&rdquo; value the survival of their companionship second&hellip; and the glint of gold and coin third. And, even though they may seem less illustrious and meritorious than their Tilean counterparts, it is wise to remember this old Estalian proverb:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;M&aacute;s has bien de reirte de nos, burlarte de nos y hartarte de nos&hellip; pero has bien de no enga&ntilde;ar a nos, o habr&aacute; de nos de quemar a ceniza la fortuna de vos&rdquo; (You&rsquo;d do well in laughing at us, mocking us and being fed up with us&hellip; but you&rsquo;d do well in not cheating us, or we will burn your fortunes to ash).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Estalian)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Almogavar Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 99.0712%;

Is this war a madman's quest for revenge, or is it the beginning of the end?&rdquo;<br />\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&mdash;Anonymous</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Skalds are the keepers of lore, the chroniclers of the histories of the Norse. Part entertainer, part warrior, these individuals are held in high esteem for their wisdom and knowledge. All Kings keep Skalds in their retinues, as do most Jarls. When the call for war is sounded, the Skald bears the banner and marches to battle with his comrades.</p>\n<p>The skald rises at an early hour, as soon as the breakfast fires in the Jarl&rsquo;s great hall are kindled. After all, he would be grieved to miss any pertinent gossip (and heartbroken to miss impertinent gossip). Also, the skald may have enemies (at least, he will if he&rsquo;s any good) and in Norsca it is wise to wake before those who hate you. A skald is a learned man, contemplating the written sagas of the Norse and talking to his elders about their recollections. He may also be a musician and, if so, will spend time practicing his craft. The skald has his ears open for news of recent events, and his eyes on any behavioral quirks of members of the jarl&rsquo;s court. The skald performs one function above all others&mdash;offering entertaining and irreverent commentary on current affairs.</p>\n<p>When the night draws in the jarl may preside over a feast and call the skald to perform. The skald sings the sagas of the Norsemen and plays sweet music. As mead flows the Northmen call for more ribald entertainment and the skald employs his skills as a mimic and comedian, mocking those in attendance, and even parodying the jarl himself.</p>\n<p>The skald treads a fine line. If he&rsquo;s careful, he will be heaped with praise and fame, and even given the honor of bearing the Jarl&rsquo;s banner in times of war. Most Northmen pride themselves on being able to take a good joke, so the Skald is confident that his targets will probably take it in good humor. However, if he takes his act too far, he may find himself hewn apart by an offended reaver.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Norscan)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Ranger</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Skald Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;

The name was derived from the condotta, or &ldquo;contract,&rdquo; by which the condottieri put themselves in the service of a city or of a lord. The first mercenary armies in Tilea (often called Dogs of War) were made up of foreigners. The earliest was composed of Estalians and men of the Empire who had fought in the wars of the south. In the mid-15th century IC Araby invaded Estalia and sent additional forces against Tilea, terrorizing the country, devastating Luccini, Trantio, and Pavona prompting an even higher demand for personal mercenary protection. The organization of the companies was perfected in the early 16th century IC by Muzioni Dollo da Fortza, in the service of Verezzo, and his rival Braccio da Monda, in the service of Remas. Muzioni&rsquo;s son, Francesco da Fortza, who won control of Miragliano in 1550 IC, was one of the most successful of all the condottieri. Due to the divisive political tensions, Tilean states began to raise more advanced mercenary armies, and soon condottieri were conquering principalities for themselves.</p>\n<p>In the late 25th Century IC, Borgio the Besieger, the most famous of the Tilean condottieri, was the Merchant Prince of Miragliano and for decades led his mercenary company in the many internal wars of northern Tilea, shocking and inspiring all the nearby city states with their skill in battle. There was not a single city that could defy him, and he fought against every principality and republic in all of Tilea. Many more famous companies and rulers such as Lorenzo Lupo and Lucrezzia Belladonna would make names for themselves alongside Borgio, but none can match the reputation of the Besieger.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The soldiers who fight under the condottieri are deeply varied depending on the company they work under: From heavily armored crossbowmen, duelists and pikemen, to heavy and shock cavalry, these diverse companies are noted for their rapacious and disorderly behavior outside of conflict but feared for their unflinching sense of discipline on the frontlines. With no goal beyond personal gain, the armies of the condottieri often change sides, and their battles can often result in high amounts of bloodshed against their former &ldquo;allies&rdquo;, so long as the pay to betray their employers was good enough to cover any lost revenue. Despite this, most modern condottieri and their companies are led and run by Tileans with their nationalities tied to the regions or city states they were born in. It is not uncommon for fledgling mercenary leaders to start their roots in their home states, but as their career progresses, they tend to sell their services to new lands within Tilea, Estalia, the Border Princes and especially the Empire.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Human (Tilean)</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Condottiero Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 634px;
